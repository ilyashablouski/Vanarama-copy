            You simply choose the car you want to drive & tailor the deal depending on the following criteria:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Your budget.
            </li>
            <li>
              The duration of your agreement.
            </li>
            <li>
              Your annual mileage.
            </li>
            <li>
              Whether you need a personal or business lease.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you want to add a maintenance package to your lease.
            </li>
          </ul>

            After choosing a vehicle, you will need to undergo a credit check. This is when the finance company verifies that you can comfortably afford the payments.

            Once your finances have been approved, you will be asked to pay a Vehicle Reservation Fee of £500 (this secures your vehicle & prevents it being leased to someone else), which is refunded to you less our administration fee of £198 after delivery of your vehicles.

                This can vary depending on the Funder. It can take as little as an hour to get a decision, but we will try to get an answer for you within 24 hours. We will sometimes get requests for further information and, in these cases, it can take slightly longer to get the final decision.
