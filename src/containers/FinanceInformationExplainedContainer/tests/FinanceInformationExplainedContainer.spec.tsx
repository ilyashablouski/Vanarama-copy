This is when the finance company verifies that you can comfortably afford the payments.\n\nOnce your finances have been approved, you will be asked to pay a Vehicle Reservation Fee of £500 (this secures your vehicle & prevents it being leased to someone else), which is refunded to you less our administration fee of £198 after delivery of your vehicles.\n\nWhen the [contract finishes](https://beta.vanarama.com/car-leasing-explained/what-happens-at-end-of-car-lease.html), the car is returned to the finance company who will send out a driver to collect it. When the vehicle is returned, it will be inspected for damage & excess mileage. You will be charged for damage considered over & above the British Vehicle Rental & Leasing Association's (BVRLA) [Fair Wear & Tear guidelines](https://beta.vanarama.com/car-leasing-explained/lease-car-fair-wear-and-tear.html) or if you have exceeded the agreed mileage allowance.\n\nDon't worry about the end-of-contract damage charges – you've been driving the vehicle for up to 5 years, a bit of damage is to be expected, that's why it's called \"Fair Wear & Tear\". Take a look at our comprehensive [wear and tear guide](https://beta.vanarama.com/car-leasing-explained/lease-car-fair-wear-and-tear.html) for more information.",
