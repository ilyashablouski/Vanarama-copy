          'Our expert Mike answered... Hello Adrian, thank you very much for leaving your question on our website. There are various leasing options available depending on what you would like to achieve at the end of the contract. If you are not VAT registered then you will not be able to claim the VAT back on the rentals, however depending on which contract you decided to go for, the rentals may well be 100% tax deductible. If you would like to discuss any of these options in greater detail, the best thing to do is contact one of our specialists on 01442 838193 or alternatively please let us know the best contact number for you and when would be a convenient time to contact you. Many thanks once again for leaving your question. Kind regards, Mike Daly.',
