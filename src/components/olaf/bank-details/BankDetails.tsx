            We have to tell you about how &quot;Your Information&quot; will be
            used in connection with your application. &quot;Your
            Information&quot; means the information you have given us, which we
            pass on to the finance company, or which they receive from their own
            enquiries and searches at the credit reference and fraud prevention
            agencies. This applies to all applicants, including directors and
            partners if the application is made by a limited company,
            partnership or an incorporated association. The finance company
            check your details with credit reference and fraud prevention
            agencies, and these agencies will record the check. They will
            provide the agencies with your current and previous names, address
            and dates of birth of all parties, so if you are providing
            information about others, on a joint application, you must be sure
            that you have their agreement. The agencies will provide them with
            public information about you and any third party financially linked
            to you. Information such as county court judgements (CCJs) and
            bankruptcies, electoral register and fraud prevention information on
            you and your financial associates, current and previous names,
            addresses and dates of birth. If false or inaccurate information is
            provided and fraud is identified, details will be passed to fraud
            prevention agencies. Law enforcement agencies may access and use
            this information. The agency searches that the finance company make,
            will leave a search footprint, both on their records and on your
            credit file at the agencies they have used, whether or not this
            application proceeds. If the search was for a credit application,
            the record of that search (but not in their name) may be seen by
            other organisations when you apply for credit in the future. If you
            made a joint application, they may link together the records of
            joint applicants, called financial associates. They will also link
            all your previous and subsequent names and addresses. Links between
            financial associates will remain on your and their files until such
            time as you or your associate successfully files for a
            disassociation with the credit reference agencies. Information
            provided may be supplied to other organisations and used by the
            agencies and them to assess you and your household for:- credit and
            credit related services; household, credit , life and other
            insurance proposals and claims; debt tracing and recovery; checking
            details of job applicants and employees, prevention of fraud and
            money laundering; managing your accounts; statistical analysis about
            credit, insurance and fraud; market research, and to verify your
            identity if you or your financial associate applies for other
            facilities, including all types of insurance applications and
            claims. They and other organisations may access and use the
            information recorded by fraud prevention agencies from other
            countries. Information about you may also be used for other purposes
            for which you have given specific information, or, in very limited
            circumstances, when required by law or where permitted under the
            terms of the Data Protection Act 1998. Credit scoring techniques
            will be used to assess your application. Data Protection Notice So
            that we may assess your application for finance, you agree that we
            may search the files of any licensed credit reference agency who
            will keep a record of that search. If the funder enters into this
            agreement with you, they will declare information about you and the
            conduct of your account at any time to any licensed credit reference
            agency. This information may be used by other lenders in assessing
            applications for finance from you and members of your household and
            occasionally for fraud prevention and trading orders. They may also
            disclose information about you and your conduct of this agreement at
            any time to any motor trader, insurance company, vehicle recovery
            tracing agent, lawyer, law enforcement agency, mailing agency, and
            our parent, associated and subsidiary companies and their respective
            agencies and contractors. I confirm that the information above is
            true and accurate. By submitting this form you confirm your
            authority for your application to be credit scored Cancellation
            Policy: Even if you&apos;ve signed an order and paid a deposit, we
            guarantee to give you a no quibble refund and we won&apos;t charge
            you a thing should you need to cancel your order. Our finance
            partners will have their own cancellation policy should you wish to
            cancel your contract once you have taken delivery of your vehicle.
            For more information on the individual cancellation policies please
